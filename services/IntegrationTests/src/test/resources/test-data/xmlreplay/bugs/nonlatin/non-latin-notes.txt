Here are the steps we tried:

On nightly.collectionspace.org, which is running Nuxeo 5.3 with mysql

    Update a record through Nuxeo Web GUI, inserting a greek psi character. 
    ==> failure: able to edit record, but on read and edit again, character is tranformed into question mark.
    
On nightly, we ran a SQL update and then a SQL dump on a table, and got the UTF8 non-Latin1 characters back. 
    ==> success: full round trip, from file.sql to MySQL to file.out .
    Note that we used the UTF8 option on the command line:
     
      mysql  -u cspace_user -p  --default_character_set utf8 nuxeo < ~/acq.sql
     
      mysqldump -u cspace_user -p nuxeo acquisitions_common_acquisitionsources > acq.out
     
On localhost which is running the older version of Nuxeo with mysql

    Update a record through Nuxeo Web GUI, inserting a greek psi character. 
    ==> success: able to read and edit record and see character.
    
    
    
Notes:
  Check the encoding of the DB:
    mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'character_set_database';
